# Readme

So, you want to submit a Switch cart to No-Intro? I developed a quick and easy Python script which standardizes forum submissions into easily-imported XML files.

Download the script [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarenight/No-Intro-Switch-Cart-Submission-Tool/main/no-intro-switch-cart-submission-tool-v1.6.py) (right click -> Save As).

You'll need Python with the PyQt5 dependency installed (`pip install pyqt5`) along with [NX Game Info](https://github.com/garoxas/NX_Game_Info) (and the appropriate prod.keys) before you get started.

First, load your default XCI within NX Game Info GUI, then export a CSV (File -> Export -> CSV):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3a6c27b-e37a-4e9e-91f9-8f62a7ac1baf)

Then open my script, click "Import NX Game Info", and drag and drop the CSV file into the window. The values will auto-populate:

Alternatively, you can paste the output that NX Game Info CLI provides you:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1493961-dd18-4d60-886a-47601ef1e932)

Then press Import. You'll (hopefully) see the Game Name, Languages, and GameID1 auto-populated. It should also populate the version and update in the File Info tab. If for whatever reason the NX Game Info import messes up, you can always manually type the values. **NOTE: THIS IMPORT TOOL DOES NOT SUPPORT MULTI-TITLE CARTS YET.**

Add the applicable cart region so all fields are filled out:

![2 game info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29369f45-bb6b-478d-a8a9-420cea7bde65)

Then click the Dump Info tab, fill out the Dumper and Tool fields, and click "Set Default Dumper and Tool" if you want those values to remain constant. Then click "Generate Card ID Values". Drag and drop the (Card ID) binary file that nxdumptool outputs into the window and the Card ID values should (hopefully) populate like this:

![3 dump info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da533739-6462-4848-bf7a-55812ac6dd8a)

A custom dump date can be specified if your cart wasn't dumped the same day.

Then click the Media Info tab and fill out all the values manually. A dropdown menu allows you to select a downwards triangle for your convenience.

![4 media info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b19b1462-2efd-4a72-87a6-cdb7ed60cbfa)

Click the File Info tab and then "Import Hashes."

Drag and drop the Initial Area BIN file, then the Default XCI file into the window and their hashes will auto-populate. My program automatically generates the Full XCI hashes without having to create the file separately. Please note this takes a while for large files and the program appears to freeze while it's hashing, please be patient.

![5 file info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b9b3e58-ac6d-4e6b-a37d-48c66e9c7a00)

My program also offers the option to generate a Full XCI file if you'd like a local copy for your collection.

When all fields are populated as shown in the above image, click "Generate Submission" and an XML file will be generated in your chosen directory.

This program generates an XML submission file that looks like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ba5ca81-21ae-453f-a038-6c76ca7620f4)

This XML submission file can then be easily imported into No-Intro's backend in a standardized and uniform format:
